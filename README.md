# OSC (Operating System Capstone) 2025
This course aims to introduce the design and implementation of operating system kernels. You’ll learn both concept and implementation from a series of labs.

This course uses Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (rpi3 for short) as the hardware platform. Students can get their hands dirty on a Real Machine instead of an emulator.

There are 7 + 1 labs in this course. You’ll learn how to design a kernel by implementing it yourself.
