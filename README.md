# OSC (Operating System Capstone) 2025
This course aims to introduce the design and implementation of operating system kernels. Youâ€™ll learn both concept and implementation from a series of labs.

This course uses Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (rpi3 for short) as the hardware platform. You can get your hands dirty on a Real Machine instead of an emulator.
